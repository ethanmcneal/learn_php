<?php
echo "I Love PHP!";?>

<!-- note the semi-colon and double quotes -->

<!-- can also be executed in the terminal eg: php IntroToPhp/howIsPhpExecuted -->


<!-- Unlike many other languages, PHP is not always case-sensitive, 
so Echo is a valid statement in PHP. However, it’s best practice to use standard casing – in this case, 
echo. -->


<?php
echo"1. Learn PHP"; 
echo "\n2. Get a job";
echo "\n3. Get a \"wife\""?>

<!-- \n for newline, \"\" for printing literal quotes -->
